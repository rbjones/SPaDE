# KR Prototyping Documentation - Action Plan

**Status**: ⚠️ Documentation refinement required before coding can begin  
**Summary**: While high-level strategy and repository format are well-defined, critical gaps exist in the ProofPower HOL interface specification that would block implementation.

## Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

### 1. Extension Grouping Algorithm - UNRESOLVED
**Problem**: No clear algorithm for grouping ProofPower constants with their defining constraints into SPaDE extensions.

**Current State**: 
> "The best way to do this is not yet clear. The two possibilities which come to mind are: [incomplete]"

**Required Action**: 
- Choose between tag-based vs. constraint-analysis approaches
- Provide complete algorithmic specification with pseudocode
- Include handling of edge cases (mutual recursion, orphaned constants)

### 2. Structure Building Process - UNDERSPECIFIED  
**Problem**: Vague description of "stack of positions" mechanism for building repository structure.

**Required Action**:
- Define precise stack-based construction algorithm
- Specify position tracking and referencing mechanism  
- Provide step-by-step procedure for theory construction

### 3. Main Procedure Interface - MISSING
**Problem**: No specification of entry point, parameters, or calling convention.

**Required Action**:
- Define main SML procedure signature
- Specify input/output parameters and configuration options
- Document error codes and return values

## Documentation Files Requiring Updates

### Immediate Priority
- `kr/ppholinterface.md` - Complete sections 2.2, 2.3, add error handling
- `kr/SPaDEppScrape.md` - Expand from stub to full specification  
- `kr/m4002.md` - Add main procedure and integration details

### Supporting Updates
- `kr/README.md` - Update links to reflect new detailed specifications
- `kr/KRproto.md` - Cross-reference completed interface specification

## Quality Assurance

### Before Implementation
- [ ] All Priority 1 issues resolved in documentation
- [ ] Sample walkthrough of complete scraping process documented
- [ ] Error handling strategies defined for all failure modes
- [ ] Testing approach specified

### Implementation Readiness Criteria
- [ ] Main procedure interface fully specified
- [ ] Extension grouping algorithm implemented and tested
- [ ] Structure building process validated with examples
- [ ] Integration with existing Python serialization verified

## Estimated Timeline
- **Documentation Refinement**: 2-3 days (assuming domain expertise available)
- **Review and Validation**: 1 day  
- **Implementation Ready**: After documentation updates complete

## Next Steps
1. Address Priority 1 documentation gaps
2. Create detailed walkthrough examples  
3. Validate specifications with domain expert review
4. Proceed to implementation phase
