# Universality in the Representation of Declarative Knowledge

## Preliminary Ruminations

A part of the rationale for SPaDE comes from the belief that there are representations of [declarative knowledge](../docs/tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge) which are *universal*, insofar as they can express any knowledge which might be expressed in any declarative language.

In order to make definitive a claim to universality, that claim must first be made precise, an early step in which is to define the concept of declarative language.
Such a definition will inevitably be to some degree arbitrary, and may to that extent limit the scope of the universality claim.
An established method for giving plausibility to a universal claim despite the need for such arbitrary choices, is to chose multiple different approaches to the definition and show that they all define the same class of languages.
This is how Church's Thesis on the concept of "effectively computable function" was supported.

Sceptics may view the necessary arbitrary choices as a kind of gerrymandering, in the face of which I am happy to fall back on offering it as an attempt to delineate the scope of important classes of declarative language, (and thence declarative knowledge), rather than pressing for its acceptance as an absolute.
There are those who challenge Church's Thesis but it is nevertheless widely accepted as delineating and important class of functions.

Having said that, I do not have here the kind of formal definition of declarative language which would be required to make the universality claim precise, which falls under a broad category of philosophical background which I would like to see made more precise
.
