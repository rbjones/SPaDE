# SPaDE Knowledge Repository - Philosophical Background

## Introduction

What I have at the moment is a mess which I should probably just throw away, but I'll adopt the slightly less drastic course of trying to reorganise it as follows.

I offer here two lists.  The first a list of the principle matters which I feel should be addressed under this heading, and the second a list of the fragmentary and poorly organised documents which are at present in place, and which should in due course be replaced or transformed into a more coherent position on the key issues.

- [Key Philosophical Issues](#key-philosophical-issues)
- [Existing Documents](#existing-documents)

## Key Philosophical Issues

I propose to approach this by talking about those aspects of the aims and philosophy of the SPaDE project as a whole which are relevant to the nature of the repository, and then describe the philosophical dimensions of the reponse to those aims in the context of the broader SPaDE philosophy.

## Existing Documents

These are primarily a jumble of approaches to the "universality" conjecture, so I'm not going to attempt to summarise them here.

They are as follows:

- [krph002.md](krph002.md)
- [krph003.md](krph003.md)
- [krph004.md](krph004.md)
- [krph005.md](krph005.md)
- [krph006.md](krph006.md)
