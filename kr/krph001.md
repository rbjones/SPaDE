# SPaDE Knowledge Repository - Philosophical Background

The structure of the [SPaDE](../docs/tlad001.md#spade) knowledge repository is informed by supposed philosophical insights into the nature of [declarative knowledge](../docs/tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge) and its representation.
This document is a brief account of those ideas, and the way in which they have influenced the design of the repository.
It is not intended to be a rigorous philosophical treatise, but rather an informal bald account of the ideas which have influenced the design of the SPaDE repository.

A part of the rationale for SPaDE comes from the belief that there are representations of [declarative knowledge](../docs/tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge) which are universal, insofar as they can express any knowledge which might be expressed in any declarative language.
In order to make definitive a claim to universality that claim must first be made precise, an early step in which is to define the concept of declarative language, which will inevitably be to some degree arbitrary, and that definition will limit the scope of the universality claim.
This may be viewed as a kind of gerrymandering, in the face of which I am happy to fall back on offering it as an attempt to delineate the scope of important classes of declarative language, and thus declarative knowledge, rather than pressing for its acceptance as an absolute.
This is a move similar to that represented by Church's Thesis in computability theory, which is widely accepted as delimiting the important class of effectively computable functions, without claiming to be an absolute definition of that concept.

Having said that, I do not have here the kind of formal definition of declarative language which would be required to make the universality claim precise, which falls under a broad category of philosophical background which I would like to see made more precise, but not at the cost of delaying the development of SPaDE.

At this point I am reorganising three separate attempts to approach this philosophical background in which the first step is cut and paste to put similar considerations in each of four documents, to which this is the introduction.  

## [Declarative Knowledge](krph004.md)

This is a first informal account of the notion of [declarative knowledge](../docs/tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge) as that concept is used in SPaDE.

## [Universality in the Representation of Declarative Knowledge](krph002.md)

This is a first informal account of concept of a *Universality* in the representation of declarative knowledge and of my reasons for believing that there are institutions whih exhibit that property.

## [The Structure of the SPaDE Repository](krph003.md)

This document begins the exposition of the structure of the SPaDE knowledge repository, which guides its implementation and application.
