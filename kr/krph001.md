# Knowledge Repository Philosophical Background

The structure of the SPaDE knowledge repository is informed by supposed philosophical insights into the nature of knowledge and its representation.
This document is a brief account of those ides, and the way in which they have influenced the design of the repository.
It is not intended to be a rigorous philosophical treatise, but rather an informal bald account of the ideas which have influenced the design.

## Declarative Knowledge

Declarative knowledge is that kind of knowledge which can be expressed in true sentences of a well defined declarative language, which is to say, that kind of language in which such sentences can be expressed.

To say that a declarative language is well defined is to say that the truth conditions of its sentences are known.

It is now the case that we have languages concerned with abstract entities whose truth conditions are very precisely known, and for which there are almost complete semi-decision procedures, usually presented as formal deductive sytems.

The meanings of languages which are about concrete rather than abstract entities are more difficult to express precisely, but may be though of a factored into two parts, of which one is the abstract part, which is about abstract entities, and the other is a mapping from concrete entities to abstract entities.

If such a factoring is used, then truth conditions for sentences about concrete entities may be expressed in terms of truth conditions for sentences about abstract entities, and will benefit from the semi-decision procedures available for the abstract part of the language.

This procedure can also be extended to cover language which is neither purely abstract nor purely concrete, but which addresses matters such as metaphysics or ethics.

Thus abstract languages may be thought of as interpretable in many non-abstract domains, and as thereby serving to represent declarative knowledge about those domains.

Among abstract languages there are differences of expressiveness, and a suitably defined notion of reducibility may be used to compare their expressive power.
It is generally accepted that there is no abstract language which is maximally expressive.
However, the syntax of many languages is capable of interpretation according to a hierarchy of abstract ontologies which may be thought to span the entire range of abstract semantic expressiveness.
The best known of these is first order set theory, whose models are the initial segments of the cumulative hierarchy of sets.
Though none of those models gives first order set theory a universal semantics, it is thought that any abstract declarative language is reducible to any member of a suitably late starting trailing segment of that family of set theories.
In terms of the relevant near complete semi-decision procedures, large cardinal axioms suffice for a while, but eventually human intuition about these principles runs must out.

In practice, and in particular, for the purposes of the kinds of reasoning required for reliable and effective engineering design, relatively weak large cardinal axioms suffice to yield something which we may think of as practically universal.

Though it is set theory which is most likely to be understood as practically universal in this way, there are many other abstract logical systems which are equally expressive, if furnished with the similarly lavish ontologies and corresponding large cardinal axioms.
Cardinality of ontology is the crucial factor.

It is therefore alleged, that practically universal languages for the representation of declarative knowledge are plentiful, and we may then pass to more mudane questions affecting the choice of a single such foundation system for knowledge representation.

The net effect of these considerations
