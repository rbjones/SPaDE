# Universality in the Representation of Declarative Knoweldge

This is an informal account of how it is that there are
representations of declarative knowledge which are universal,
insofar as they can express any knowledge which might be expressed
in any declarative language.

Though this is expressed in a very definite way, there are two ways
in which it demands qualification.

* The first is that it depends upon a definition of
_declarative knowledge_, which in turn rests upon a notion of
_declarative language_, for both of which I would have to defer to
a slightly more formal account of the thesis.

* The second is more subtle and more difficult to express,
and relates to limitation in the expressiveness of language in which
only countably many things may be said by contrast with the richness
of just the abstract universe, with its arbitrartily large cardinalities,
about which we might like to talk in declarative language.


First I must give an informal account of the rationale
which underpins the claim to represent declarative knowledge
in general, and in whatever declarative language it might be
oresented, in the abstract logical system which underpins
the Cambridge HOL ITP (derivative of Church's Stimple THeory of Types).

It is implicit in the pratice of formalisation using HOL that
empirical phenomena can be modelled to whatever level
of precision required in the purely logical system supported
by the Cambridge HOL Interactive Theorem Prover (subject to
limits imposed by complexity, human frailty and
the state of the art in and )
