# The Knowledge Repository

This directory covers the architecture, design and implementation of the Knowledge Repository component of the [SPaDE](../docs/tlad001.md#spade) project.

The files in this directory are organized as follows:

- **[Philosophical Background](#philosophical-background)** (krph) - Foundational philosophical ideas influencing the design of the knowledge repository.
- **[Architectural Design](#architectural-design)** (krad) - High-level architecture and design of the knowledge repository.
- **[High Level Design](#high-level-design)** (krhd) - Detailed high-level design considerations for the knowledge repository.
- **[Detailed Design](#detailed-design)** (krdd) - Low-level design and implementation details.
- **[Code](#code)** (krcd)- Detailed formal specifications and code.
- **[Testing and Evaluation](#testing-and-evaluation)** (krte) - Prototyping strategies and implementations for the knowledge repository.

## Philosophical Background

This section includes documents that provide the philosophical context and rationale for the design of the Knowledge Repository.
This supplements the general philosophical materials in the [docs](../docs/README.md) directory.

At the moment we have three muddled documents in this section, which will be rationalised in due course.

- [krph001.md](krph001.md) - Knowledge Repository Philosophical Background
- [krph002.md](krph002.md) - Universality in the Representation of [Declarative Knowledge](../docs/tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge)
