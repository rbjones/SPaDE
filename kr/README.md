# Knowledge Repository (KR)

This directory contains the implementation and specifications for the Knowledge Repository component of the SPaDE project.

## Overview

The Knowledge Repository is a core component of the SPaDE architecture that provides a distributed, shared repository for declarative knowledge. It breaks with the traditional LCF paradigm by decoupling knowledge storage from the deductive kernel, enabling a more flexible and scalable architecture.

## Key Features

- **Universal Representation**: Uses Cambridge HOL as a universal abstract representation for all declarative knowledge
- **Distributed Architecture**: Supports widely distributed shared knowledge repositories
- **Version Control**: Maintains versioned contexts or theories in a WORM repository
- **Multi-language Support**: Supports diverse languagess through the abstract syntax of HOL (concrete syntax dealt with at other levels)
- **Diverse Storage Support** as well as read/write support for native repositories, read access to diverse knowledge and data sources will be supported by special interfaces using metadat for interpretation.
- **Consistency Management**: Ensures logical consistency across distributed repositories

## Architecture

The Knowledge Repository is structured around the concept of **contexts** - versioned signatures that contain:

- Type assignments for constant names
- Constraints (Boolean terms) on those names
- Metadata and relationships to other contexts

### Core Concepts

- **Context**: A signature with type assignments and constraints
- **Extension**: Conservative additions to existing contexts
- **Constraint**: Boolean terms that must be satisfied
- **Metadata**: Contexts that describe other contexts

## Strategies Tactics and Plans

## Contributing

See the main project [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for general guidelines.

Software supporting the knowledge repository is not a single monolith, because it is required to provide access from multiple programming languages and environments, to multiple forms of stored information viewed as theories in the repository.

We therefore require an abstract specification of the abstract structure of the repository, and a variety of interfaces which mediate between stored data and software systems interpreting the stored representations as theories in the repository, and presenting that interpretation in a form suitable for the specific programming environment.

There are therefore many opportunities for collaboration by contributing to the development of these interfaces and specifications.

Some stored forms will have been specifically designed for this repository, but others will be heritage formats that need to be interpreted, a process which essentially consists in making explicit the semantics of the data.
In these latter cases, the metadata supplying that interpretation may (and ideally should) be held in the knowledge repository as metatheory.
