# The Knowledge Repository

An important feature of the SPaDE project,by comparison with prior support for reasoning in HOL is the aim to use HOL as an underlying abstract representation for declarative knowledge of all kinds, and to support an architecture for knowledge representation which is suitable for the entire body of declarative knowledge of the human race and its intelligent progeny.

This document is a first approach to turning that idea into a formal specification and implementation.

The story may be split into two parts.

* The first part would then be the reasons for believing that the abstract syntax of Cambridge HOL is universal for the representation of declarative knowledge.
For which, see [Knowledge Representation Universality](KRUniversality.md).
* The second part addresses the structure proposed for a widely distributed shared repository of declarative knowledge thus represented.
