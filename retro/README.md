# Retro directory

This directory is for materials which predate this project and/or are not
intended for inclusion in any of the products in the forms found here.

It is anticipated that in researching and bootstrapping
the new technology work undertaken using or adapting existing tools,
for example ProofPower or possibly Clean, will be necessary or desitable.

## Available Materials

- [np directory overview](np/README.md)

## Subdirectory `np`

In the first instance the materials found in the np directory come from
research conducted by me using ProofPower over a 30 year period, and may
contribute to the formal specification of the
proposed logical kernel and the facilities for defining inductive
datatypes, which, though not part of the kernel are necessary for the
reflexive reasoning which will be essential to the self-extension of the
very elementary core capabilities of the kernel.
