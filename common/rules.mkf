# The following rules are provided for all SPaDE subsystems.
#
# They apply selectively to groups of files listed in make variables.
# Those variables must be set by the subsystem makefile which includes these rules.
# Often the rules may be making files,
# in which case the files they make will be the targets for the rules.
# In other cases, a prominent example is when loading a theory
# into a polyml datatbase, no file provides a satisfactory target and files may then
# be created to flag completion of the task. This will normally be done by using the
# language code ldd (loaded) on the root of the file being processed.
# The same code is used for multiple purposes, so the rules are conditional
# on presence in a group defined as a make variable.

# The following variables should be set in the parent makefile.
# python:
# PYTESTOPTIONS options to be set when running python test scripts
# PPDBNAME the root name of the ProofPower database to be used.
# PYMODULES Python source files to be checked
# PYTESTS Python test scripts to be run.
# ProofPower:
# PPSML
# HOL4:
# H4SML
# Sometimes code may be included in markdown.
# In that case the markdown file should be mentioned in one or more of the following variables,
# according to which languages are included.
# MDWITHSML

# The following variables used in the rules are derived from them.

PYCHECKLDD=$(PYMODULES:.py=.ldd)

# The following are variables use in the rules,
# they are not necessarily the ones to be set in the parent script.
#
# PPDBNAME is the database name for the processing of SML by ProofPower
# PPLDD is the target files for loading .sml into ProofPower
# PYCHECKLDD is the target files for checking .py files.
# PYTESTLDD is the target files for running tests written in python
