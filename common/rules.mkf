# The following rules are provided for all SPaDE subsystems.
#
# They apply selectively to groups of files listed in make variables.
# Those variables must be set by the subsystem makefile which includes these rules.
# Often the rules may be making files,
# in which case the files they make will be the targets for the rules.
# In other cases, a prominent example is when loading a theory
# into a polyml datatbase, no file provides a satisfactory target and files may then
# be created to flag completion of the task. This will normally be done by using the
# language code ldd (loaded) on the root of the file being processed.
# The same code is used for multiple purposes, so the rules are conditional
# on presence in a group defined as a make variable.

# The following variables should be set in the parent makefile.

# python:
# PYTESTOPTIONS options to be set when running python test scripts
# PPDBNAME the root name of the ProofPower database to be used.
# PYMODULES Python source files to be checked
# PYTESTS Python test scripts to be run.

# Standard ML:
# PPSMLSIG SML signature files to be loaded into the ProofPower database
# PPSMLSTRUCT SML structure files to be loaded into the ProofPower database
# PPSMLTEST SML unit test files to be loaded into the ProofPower database
# HOL4 SML files to be loaded into HOL4
# 
# Sometimes code may be included in markdown.
# In that case the markdown file should be mentioned in one or more of the following variables,
# according to which languages are included.

# MDWITHSML

# Default python interpreter (can be overridden by parent makefile)
PYTHON ?= python3

# The following variables used in the rules are derived from them.
