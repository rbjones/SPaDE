# agprop: Propositional Logic Theorem Prover Environment for AlphaZero

This directory contains the environment for a propositional logic theorem prover using primitive inference rules, designed to integrate with AlphaZero.

## Files

- `proplogic.py`: Main environment implementation (game logic, rules, state transitions)
- `__init__.py`: Marks this as a Python package
- `README.md`: This file
- `train.py`: Script to train/test the environment (template)

## Usage

- Import and use `proplogic.py` as an environment in AlphaZero.
- Extend or modify for more advanced logics (e.g., HOL) as needed.
