# Contributing to SPaDE

Information for contributors to the SPaDE project is at present somewhat disorganized and incomplete.

Initially the project is a collaboration between the repository owner (Roger Jones) and AI tools, primarily github copilot-pro.
The existing documentation is a present oriented towards guidance for copilot and consists of:

- [Instructions for Copilot](.github/copilot-instructions.md)

- [For AI Contributors](docs/admin/ForAIContributors.md)

- [Collaboration Methods](docs/admin/collaboration-methods.md)

I encourage anyone interested in contributing to consider starting their own related project developing agents to supply specialist servives in the network of agents which is envisaged, but they may nevertheless wish to engage with SPaDE itself to influence the nature of that network.
If there are no better guidelines and suggestions available by then a first contribution might be to offer some.
