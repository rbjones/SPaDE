SPaDE Deductive Architecture

Intelligent support for formal engineering in SPaDE will be provided by the implementation of a logical kernel for the HOL logic together with layered alpha-zero like proof automation, in which each theory has a specialist neural in its subject matter using monte carlo tree search with heuristics built by re-inforcement learning, as well as access to the specialists for each of the constituent theories (ancestors).

A survey of approaches to organising such a heirarchic intelligence network will be required before this can be significantly progressed.
