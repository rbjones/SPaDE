# Deductive Kernel (DK)

This directory contains the documentation prototyping and implementation of the Deductive Kernel component of the SPaDE project.
(initially written by Alan, an LLM on the basis of an insufficient briefing and not yet fully aligned with the project's goals).

## Overview

The Deductive Kernel is the core logical inference engine that ensures the rigour of the formal reasoning taking place in the SPaDE project and makes possible intelligence and productivity of the system in deductive engineering.

## Key Features

This is a conception of logical kernel derivative but divergent from the LCF paradigm.
Its connection with the LCF paradigm will be evident in the similarity of much of the formal kernal specification with existing LCF implementations of proof support for HOL.
However certain features present in LCF systems but technically going beyond it are central to the design of the Deductive Kernel, and become dominant features in its exploitation.

- **Abstract Logical Engine**: Completely divorced from concrete syntax and persistent theory representation.
- **Reflexive Capabilities**: The kernel admits the direct use of derived rules which are proven consistent with the specified derivability relation.
- **Derived Rules Instead of Tactics**: Derived rules play the role previously assumed by tactics, yielding the theorem which would normally be supplied by the tactic.
- **AI Integration**: Designed to work with AI which will use neural net heuristics in proof search and will implement derived rules for common inference patterns.
- **Efficient Execution**: Supports direct execution of verified algorithms

## Architecture

The Deductive Kernel operates on contexts from the Knowledge Repository and delivers theorems derivable in those contexts.
Unlike traditional LCF systems, it does not manipulate the repository directly - theorems are not automatically added to contexts.

### Core Concepts

- **Context**: The logical environment for inference (provided by KR)
- **Theorem**: A proposition proven to be derivable in a context
- **Tactic**: A verified algorithm for proof construction
- **Metatheory**: The theory of the logical system itself
- **Reflexive Reasoning**: The ability to reason about the system within itself

## Key Innovations

### 1. LCF Evolution

The kernel evolves beyond the traditional LCF paradigm by:

- Separating logical inference from theory management
- Supporting verified tactics that can be trusted without detailed proof
- Enabling reflexive reasoning about the system itself

### 2. Reflexive Capabilities

The kernel is designed to support:

- Self-analysis through metatheory
- Verification of its own algorithms
- Self-improvement through reflexive reasoning
- AI-assisted development of its own capabilities

### 3. AI Integration

Designed to intersect with AI capabilities:

- AI-assisted proof generation
- Verified tactics that can be trusted
- Human-AI collaboration models
- Automated verification of AI-generated proofs

## Related Components

- **Knowledge Repository (kr/)**: Provides contexts for logical inference
- **API Layer**: Interfaces for accessing kernel capabilities
- **Tools**: Development and verification tools

## Development Priorities

1. **Complete formal specifications** for the logical system
2. **Implement core inference engine** (type checking, proof checking)
3. **Design metatheory framework** for reflexive reasoning
4. **Create verified tactic system**
5. **Build AI integration interfaces**

## Technical Challenges

### 1. Metatheory Formalization
- Formalizing the theory of the logical system within itself
- Ensuring consistency of reflexive reasoning
- Managing the complexity of self-reference

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Efficient theorem proving for large knowledge bases
- Optimized tactic execution
- Scalable proof checking

### 3. AI Integration
- Interfaces for AI-assisted proof generation
- Verification of AI-generated proofs
- Human-AI collaboration protocols
