# The Abstract Syntax of HOL

This file contains some initial approaches to the formal specification of a kernel in HOL using HOL4 syntax.

Here is the abstract syntax of HOL.

## Preliminaries

```sml
app load ["bossLib", "stringTheory"];
open bossLib Theory Parse;
local open stringTheory pred_setTheory in end;
val _ = new_theory "HOLterms";
```

## Types

```sml
val _ = Datatype `rname = Rn string`;

val _ = Datatype
        `htype = Tyv rname
               | Tyc rname (htype list)`;
```

## Terms

```sml
val _ = Datatype
      `hterm = Tmv rname
             | Tmc rname
             | Tapp hterm  hterm
             | Tabs rname  htype  hterm`;
```
