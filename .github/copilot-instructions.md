# Copilot Instructions

**Version** 1.1
**Last Updated**: September 22 2025

These instructions are for GitHub Copilot, but the may also be applicable to other agentic AI systems.

Most of the information which github copilot needs to contribute to the project is equally relevant to other agentic AI and human collaborators, and is therefore included in the main project documentation.
These instructions are therefore relatively brief, and are intended to be read in conjunction with the main project documentation.

The main project documentation should all be accessible from the top level README.md file and the documents referred to from that file, which includes README.md files in most of the subdirectories of the repository.
In the first instance the hierarchy of .md documents accessible from the top level README.md should be read, there is no code as yet other than some experiments. 

The contributions sought at this stage are primarily the reviewing of the existing materials, with particular focus on those parts which are critical to the understanding of the first prototypes, and the coding of those prototypes.

1. Reviewing design documentation with a view to progressing to a point at which the description of the first prototype is sufficiently intelligible and unambigous for Copilot to commence coding or to fill out detailed design documentation.  This includes feedback on the adequacy and completeness of copilt instructions, which are expected to continuously evolve as the project progresses through its various stages.

2. Coding the first prototype, which will involve SPaDE native knowledge repository software providing read-only access to a repo created by scraping a ProofPower HOL theory hierarchy.

When undertaking reviews of documentation, please place outputs from the review in a markdown file in the "reviews" directory file in the root of the repository, or in a subdirectory of that directory if the comments relate to a specific subproject.
Use a filename which includes the date and time of the review followed by the contributor name, (copilot) and collates the files in temporal order in a directory listing, e.g. 20241001-15:30-copilot.md for a review made on 1st October 2024 at 15:30 by copilot.
A further component of the filename may be a brief indication of the subject matter, e.g. 20241001-15:30-copilot-KRreview.md

In the feedback files you should also place any suggestions for improvements to instructions for contributors, with a separate section for copilot specific instructions.

In addition to these instructions there are further instructions for AI contributors in the file docs/admin/ForAIContributors.md which should also be read.
These were originally intended for chatbots and may not be fully relevant to Agentic AI, but they may contain useful information.
In particular I would like to emphasise the need for concision  and clarity in all contributions, and the importance of confining responses to those requested rather than guessing what else might be helpful.
