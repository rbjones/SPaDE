# Synthetic Philosophy and Deductive Engineering

This project seeks to progress the proliferation of benign intelligence across the cosmos from small beginnings here on earth.

The _purpose_ is derived from ethical principles in the context of pragmatic constraints, taking into account the fundamental imperative of evolution.

Its progression is considered as an engineering process in which the means to proliferation are engineered and applied by ever advancing intelligent infrastructure exploiting and continually advancing a distributed shared repository of declarative knowledge.

The contribution sought by this project to that purpose is in two principle areas.
The first is concerned with the management of that shared repository.
The second with the architecture and fundamental core of the deductive intelligence which is the engine of proliferation.

Further elaboration of the 'synthetic philosophy' which underpins the project, and the architecture for proliferation which emerges from it, appears in the [docs](docs/README.md) directory, together with all other project documentation not specific to the two subsystems of special concern.

The [kr](kr/README.md) directory contains those parts of the project contributing to the architecture of the distributed repository of declarative knowledge.

The [dk](dk/README.md) directory contains those parts of the project contributing to and building beyond the deductive kernel.
The deductive kernel is the part of the system which guarantees the soundness of deduction.
This directory also covers the architecture for intelligence distributed throughout the knowledge repository.
