# Synthetic Philosophy and Deductive Engineering

This project seeks to progress the proliferation of benign intelligence across the cosmos from small beginnings here on earth, complementing and merging with similar progressions from other points of origin.

The _purpose_ is derived from ethical principles in the context of pragmatic constraints, taking into account the fundamental imperative of evolution.

Its progression is considered as an engineering process in which the means to proliferation are engineered and applied by ever advancing intelligent infrastructure exploiting and continually advancing a distributed shared repository of declarative knowledge.

The contribution sought by this project to that purpose is in two principle areas.
The first is concerned with the management of that shared repository.
The second with the architecture and fundamental core of the deductive intelligence which is the engine of proliferation.

The fundamental insights upon which the SPaDE architecture is based are:

1. That there are universal representations for declarative knowledge, the simplest of which is the higher order logic derived from Alonzo Church's Simple Theory of Types (which is adopted by SPaDE).

2. That all deductive reasoning takes place in _perfect information spaces_, which are domains in which intelligence can most effectively be applied by _focal_ methods rather than by large language models.

Further elaboration of the 'synthetic philosophy' which underpins the project, and the architecture for proliferation which emerges from it, appears in the [docs](docs/README.md) directory, together with all other project documentation not specific to the three subsystems of special concern.

The [kr](kr/README.md) directory contains those parts of the project contributing to the architecture of the distributed repository of declarative knowledge.

The [dk](dk/README.md) directory contains those parts of the project contributing to the deductive kernel.
The deductive kernel is the part of the system which guarantees the soundness of deduction.

The [di](di/README.md) directory contains the support for deductive intelligence which makes feasible the application of deduction and the transition to a deductive rather than a computation paradigm for information processing.  This wraps the deductive kernel with layers of focal intelligence making use of multilayered neural nets closely coupled with the heirarchy of logical contexts found in the distributed knowledge repository.
