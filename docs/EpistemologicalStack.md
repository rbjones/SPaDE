An Epistemological Stack

David Hume's philosophy provides a tripartite partition of what can be known in two distinctions.
The first distinguishes "relations between ideas" and "matters of fact".
The second comes in his insistance that one cannot derive an _ought_ from an _is_.
This trichotomy can be cut according to different criteria, which are often considered to coincident by positivists, a position contested by others, notable Immanmual Kant.

The distinctions, as they are drawn here, are semantic.
These are presented as forming a _stack_ in which language aggregates as we pass to the higher levels, and the lower levels are logically independent of the upper.
