# Collaboration Guidelines

## AI Contributions

In this project I will be learning how to use AI in software development and how to build applications involving AI.
I expect that before long agentic AI will be capable of contributing to the project in similar ways to human contributors, with their own github users independently progressing aspects of the development and eventually offering them as pull requests.
(I'm fairly basic in my github usage but this may change as I become more familiar with the tools and workflows.)

I have another document specifically intended for [AI contributors](forAIcontributors.md).
This document was written by one of them, going past what I actually asked for, and in fact primarily addresses relationship between me (Bertie) and the AI (possibly GPT 4.1, but called Alan).
I thought I would personalise the relationship by giving names to us, but at the moment there is still too much instability in the AI contributions since I am working out which works best for me in which IDE, which may take some time.
At the moment the agentic AI is mostly github copilot-pro and the GPT model was accessed through the free tier on Cursor, which doesn't give enough to be viable.
I do have a Grok API key, and that works in VSCode, but I'm still mainly using copilot.

This document outlines the methods and standards for effective human/AI collaboration in the SPaDE project.

## Core Principles

### 1. Alignment with Vision

- It's important for contributions in this repo to align with my philosophical vision and architectural proposals, and these are as yet very poorly documented.
- So at this stage the contributions most welcome are comments, but really, best to wait a bit until there is more coherent and complete documentation available.
- I will be trying in the course of setting out the architecture to identify kinds of functionality that would contribute to the grand plan and are suitable for independent development in separate repositories.

### 2. Iterative Refinement

- Work proceeds in cycles of proposal, review, and refinement
- No major decisions are final without Bertie's validation
- Continuous improvement based on experience and feedback

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

- All decisions, rationales, and processes are documented
- Clear traceability from high-level vision to implementation details
- Transparent communication of progress and issues

### 4. Quality Assurance

- Multiple levels of validation (technical, philosophical, strategic)
- Regular review sessions to ensure alignment
- Clear criteria for success and completion

## Working Methods

### Proposal Development

1. **Alan** identifies gaps or opportunities based on project analysis
2. **Alan** develops detailed proposals with multiple options
3. **Alan** documents rationale and implications for each option
4. **Bertie** reviews and provides direction on preferred approach
5. **Alan** refines proposal based on feedback
6. **Bertie** validates final approach before implementation

### Implementation Process

1. **Alan** creates detailed specifications and documentation
2. **Alan** implements technical components systematically
3. **Alan** provides regular progress updates and status reports
4. **Bertie** reviews major milestones and provides guidance
5. **Alan** refines implementation based on feedback
6. **Bertie** validates final deliverables

### Review and Validation

1. **Alan** conducts technical validation and testing
2. **Bertie** conducts philosophical and strategic validation
3. **Joint review** sessions for major deliverables
4. **Documentation** of all validation results and decisions
5. **Iterative refinement** based on validation feedback

## Decision Making Framework

### Decision Types

1. **Strategic Decisions**: Made by Bertie with Alan's input
2. **Architectural Decisions**: Collaborative with Bertie's validation
3. **Implementation Decisions**: Made by Alan within Bertie's guidance
4. **Technical Decisions**: Made by Alan with documentation for review

### Decision Documentation

- **Rationale**: Clear explanation of why decision was made
- **Alternatives**: Consideration of other options
- **Implications**: Impact on other components and future work
- **Validation**: How decision aligns with vision and requirements

## Conflict Resolution

### Issue Identification

- **Clear Problem Statement**: Precise description of the issue
- **Impact Assessment**: Effect on project goals and timeline
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Understanding of underlying causes
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Effect on different project components

### Resolution Process

1. **Issue Documentation**: Clear description of the problem
2. **Analysis**: Understanding of causes and implications
3. **Proposal Development**: Multiple resolution options
4. **Bertie's Review**: Strategic and philosophical validation
5. **Implementation**: Execution of chosen resolution
6. **Validation**: Confirmation that issue is resolved
