# Project Management

Interaction with the project will be managed through GitHub Projects.
This is a facility which is still evolving, and I will update this documentation as I learn how to use it effectively.

A github project has been set up for [SPaDE](../tlad001.md#spade), so the terminology used here when discussing plans will reflect that useed by the github project management system and will evolve with it
All activities in such a project have to be set up as "issues" and dependencies between these issues are registered as "blocks".
In this discussion I will use the term "task" to refer to an issue which is a significant piece of work, and "subtask" to refer to a smaller piece of work which is part of a larger task.
Subtasks are registered as "child" issues, the task being the "parent" issue.
So far the [SPaDE](../tlad001.md#spade) "project" covers only the first MCP server prototype.

I have found it difficult to see the dependencies between tasks, with the facilities available and have therefore adopted the practice of prefacing each task title with a number indicating its place in the sequence of tasks as well as the parent/child relationships.
Thus (for example) task 3.2 is the second subtask of task 3.
The sequences of tasks and subtasks will be documented in the project management system.

Meanwhile I have a top level planning rumination [ampl001.md](ampl001.md) which will be reviewed to address a strategy plan not yet reflected in the project management system.
