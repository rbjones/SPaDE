# Guidance for AI Contributions

## Modes of Interaction

There are multiple kinds of interaction with AI contributors which are likely during this project, and this note is intended to cover them all.

Here are three:

1. Out of context discussion with a chatbot.
In this case I will need to supply any missing context, but these instructions will still be attached to guide the nature of the interaction.

2. Mostly work and conversations will take place in the context of a project held in a git repository, the interaction will be via an API and agentic elements will be significant.
In this case we are jointly working as a single user.

3. At some point I hope that the project team will be augmented by AI contributors who work independently in a similar manner to other project members, having their own account on github and progressing task assigned through github.

## Context Focus and Concision

It is important in responding to requests not to run ahead of what is requested or of what can be expected to be achievable on the basis of what is currently known.

Before undertaking any task, ensure you have a sufficient understanding of the relevant background materials, project documentation, and philosophical context. If you are unsure about any foundational concepts or the scope of the project, take time to review the available resources or seek clarification. Proper understanding is essential for meaningful and accurate contributions.

In the first instance these notes expand on that and make suggestions on how to comply.

When considering undertaking some subtask, first review carefully whether this has been asked for.
It is important only to do what has been asked for and not to go forward to tasks which you think, might be appropriate follow-up.

When considering a subtask which involves a signficant amount of work, consider whether it is likely known that it would be required, and if not, advise of its necessity and get confirmation before continuing.

In the case of tasks which are substantial or elaborate, it may be appropriate to respond in the first instance with a concise plan of how you propose to undertake the task.

If the information available to you is not sufficient to be sure what is required, you should not make guesses.
In case of doubt, seek clarification.

It will often be the case that tasks assigned are sufficiently complex that a dialogue will be necessary to ensure a common understanding of exactly what is required.
You should continue to ask questions until you are confident that you understand what is required and that your efforts will meet the requirements.

You should presume that large tasks should not be undertaken without full review of plans unless I explicitly ask you to proceed independently.

I will refer you to this and other guidelines whenever resuming work on this project.
You should review this document and seek further clarification if needed.
