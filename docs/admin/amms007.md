# Glossary Augmentation Procedure

## Purpose

This document describes the procedure for systematically expanding the SPaDE glossary by identifying important technical terms in the project documentation that are not yet covered, and drafting glossary entries for consideration.

## Scope

This procedure applies to all markdown (.md) files in the SPaDE repository, excluding:

- The `reviews/` directory
- The `retro/` directory  
- Any directory whose name begins with `.`
- The glossary file itself (`docs/tlad001.md`)

## Procedure Overview

### Phase 1: Term Discovery

#### 1.1 Automated Term Extraction

1. **Scan all eligible markdown files** for potential technical terms
2. **Extract candidate terms** using linguistic patterns:
   - Capitalized phrases (2-4 words)
   - Technical compounds (e.g., "knowledge repository", "deductive kernel")
   - Domain-specific terminology (AI, logic, philosophy terms)
   - Project-specific concepts and methodologies

#### 1.2 Term Filtering

1. **Remove common words** and general language
2. **Exclude existing glossary terms** by comparing against current `docs/tlad001.md`
3. **Filter by frequency** - terms appearing in multiple files or contexts
4. **Prioritize by importance** based on:
   - Usage frequency across files
   - Centrality to project architecture
   - Technical complexity requiring definition
   - Potential confusion or ambiguity

### Phase 2: Term Analysis

#### 2.1 Contextual Review

For each candidate term:

1. **Identify all occurrences** across the documentation
2. **Analyze usage contexts** to understand meaning and scope
3. **Check for consistency** in how the term is used
4. **Assess definitional need** - does the term require clarification?

#### 2.2 Categorization

Group candidate terms by:

- **Domain**: Architecture, Philosophy, Engineering, AI/ML, etc.
- **Type**: Concept, Process, Component, Methodology, etc.
- **Priority**: Critical, Important, Nice-to-have
- **Complexity**: Simple definition vs. detailed explanation needed

### Phase 3: Glossary Entry Drafting

#### 3.1 Entry Structure

For each selected term, draft entries following the existing glossary format:

```markdown
### Term Name

Brief, clear definition of the term as used in the SPaDE context.

Additional explanation if needed, including:
- Relationship to other glossary terms
- Project-specific usage or meaning
- Key characteristics or properties

#### Variations or Related Terms
- **Related Term 1**: Brief explanation
- **Related Term 2**: Brief explanation
```

#### 3.2 Content Guidelines

- **Concise but complete** - capture essential meaning without excessive detail
- **SPaDE-specific** - focus on how terms are used within this project
- **Cross-referenced** - link to related existing glossary entries
- **Accessible** - avoid circular definitions or overly technical language
- **Consistent** - match tone and style of existing entries

### Phase 4: Integration Process

#### 4.1 Review and Validation

1. **Technical accuracy** - verify definitions are correct
2. **Consistency check** - ensure alignment with existing glossary
3. **Completeness assessment** - confirm all important aspects covered
4. **Style conformance** - match existing glossary formatting and tone

#### 4.2 Glossary Integration

1. **Propose additions** through standard review process
2. **Organize alphabetically** within appropriate sections
3. **Update cross-references** in existing entries as needed
4. **Run glossary linking** to add links to new terms throughout documentation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Automated Term Discovery

#### Text Processing Pipeline

1. **Extract markdown content** excluding code blocks, links, and headers
2. **Identify noun phrases** using natural language processing
3. **Filter by linguistic patterns**:
   - Multi-word technical terms
   - Capitalized compound phrases  
   - Domain-specific vocabulary
4. **Rank by significance metrics**:
   - Document frequency (appears in multiple files)
   - Term frequency (repeated within documents)
   - Structural importance (appears in headings, key sections)

#### Example Candidate Terms

Based on current documentation, candidate terms might include:

- "Pansophic Repository"
- "Reflexive Capabilities"
- "Perfect Information Spaces"
- "Epistemic Engines"
- "Logical Kernel"
- "Abstract Syntax"
- "Deductive Verification"

### Manual Review Process

#### Priority Assessment Matrix

Rate each candidate term on:

- **Usage Frequency**: How often does it appear? (1-5)
- **Conceptual Importance**: How central to SPaDE? (1-5)  
- **Definitional Need**: How likely to confuse readers? (1-5)
- **Current Clarity**: How well-defined in context? (1-5)

Priority Score = (Usage + Importance + Need) - Clarity

#### Review Documentation

For each glossary augmentation cycle, create a review report documenting:

- Terms discovered and analysis process
- Rationale for inclusion/exclusion decisions
- Draft definitions for review
- Integration recommendations

## Quality Assurance

### Definition Quality Criteria

- **Accuracy**: Technically correct within SPaDE context
- **Clarity**: Understandable to intended audience
- **Completeness**: Covers essential aspects without excess
- **Consistency**: Aligns with existing glossary style and content
- **Utility**: Actually helps readers understand the concept

### Validation Process

1. **Technical review** by domain experts
2. **Usage verification** against actual documentation contexts
3. **Cross-reference validation** with existing glossary entries
4. **Style and formatting review** for consistency

## Integration with Existing Procedures

### Relationship to Glossary Linking (amtd002.md)

- Glossary augmentation **precedes** linking reviews
- New terms discovered here become candidates for linking procedures
- Linking reviews may identify gaps that feed back to augmentation

### Coordination with Documentation Updates

- Major documentation changes trigger glossary review
- New subsystems or major features require glossary assessment
- Regular quarterly reviews to catch incremental term evolution

## Tools and Automation

### Recommended Implementation

1. **Term extraction script** to identify candidates automatically
2. **Frequency analysis** to prioritize terms by usage patterns
3. **Context extraction** to gather usage examples for definition drafting
4. **Integration validation** to check proposed entries against existing content

### Output Formats

- **Candidate term list** with frequency and context data
- **Draft glossary entries** in standard markdown format
- **Integration report** documenting rationale and recommendations
- **Usage analysis** showing where new terms appear in documentation
