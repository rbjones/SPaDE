# Roles, Responsibilities, Tasks

I have an ambivalent attitude to this area at present, wanting to retain flexibility, but also recognising the need for clarity.

Consequently I am putting down some initial thoughts which will evolve.

Clarity on what is to be done, who is to do it, and how it is to be done will be important for effective collaboration between human and AI contributors.
But assigning roles rather than tasks is not something I am keen on, not least because it is natural to expect the capabilities of AI contributors to evolve rapidly.

It is intended that this should eventually become a widely distributed collaborative enterprise in which many independent contributors participate.
The project architecture will be developed with that in mind, and no individual will have authority over the whole.
In that situation each contributor will make his own decisions about what contribution he will make, will have his own repositories, and will deploy his own agents to deliver his contribution into the ecosystem.

On the other hand, there may be collaboration within such independent contributions, and, in those more closely coupled collaboration, someone needs to be in charge and to make the final decisions about what is to be done and how.
At this stage it is me and copilot, and I will be making all the decisions, though copilot will be reviewing my own work.
