# Task Description for Augmentation of the SPaDE Glossary

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this task is to maintain the SPaDE project glossary by drafting additional entries relating to terminology used in the project documentation but omitted from the glossary.

## Background

The SPaDE project glossary is contained in [tlad001.md](../tlad001.md).
It is intended to provide definitions and explanations of special terminology and abuse of language used in the SPaDE project documentation.
Entries in the glossary are ideally linked to the most appropriate first account of the terminology in the project documentation, either as a document or a section within a document, which provides the best available account of its meaning and usage.
Otherwise a phrase, sentence or short paragraph in the glossary must suffice.

The project documentation in the scope of this review consists in the .md files in the docs directory and its subdirectories, excluding the `reviews/` and `retro/` directories and any directory whose name begins with `.`.

## Task Description

Before undertaking this task, familiarise yourself with the contents of the glossary in [tlad001.md](../tlad001.md) and the relevant parts of the project documentation.
There will already have been a review of the documentation to repair any broken hyperlinks, so repair of broken links is not part of this task, but any encoutered should be reported.

The next stage is to review the project documentation against the glossary to identify any terminology used in the documentation which is not included in the glossary.
Priority should be given to terminology which is specific to the SPaDE project, or which has a special meaning or usage in the context of the project.
For each such terms, identify the most appropriate document or section within a document which provides the best available account of its meaning and usage.
Draft a proposed entry for the glossary including the term, its definition or explanation, and a link to the relevant document or section.
In default of a suitable link destination, a phrase, sentence or short paragraph in the glossary should be prepared giving your best effort at a definition or explanation.

This task is concerned only with the drafting of proposed new entries for the glossary linked to relevant parts of the project documentation.
It does not cover the linking of usage of the term in the project documentation to the glossary entry, which is a separate task.

## Deliverables

The end product should be a new draft of the project glossary in a pull request including the proposed new entries, and a report should be entered into the reviews directory of SPaDE with a name conforming to the document naming conventions specific to reviews in [amms001.md](amms001.md).
