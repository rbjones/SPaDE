# Task Description for Augmentation of the SPaDE Glossary

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this task is to incrementally augment the [SPaDE](../tlad001.md#spade) project glossary by identifying and drafting entries for important technical terms used in the project documentation that are not yet in the glossary.

The project documentation in scope consists of .md files in the SPaDE repository, excluding the `reviews/` and `retro/` directories and any directory whose name begins with `.`.

## Background

The [SPaDE](../tlad001.md#spade) project glossary is in [tlad001.md](../tlad001.md).
It provides definitions and explanations of special terminology used in the project.

Glossary entries should ideally link to detailed accounts elsewhere in the documentation. If a suitable explanation exists in the documentation, the glossary heading should link to it and the glossary text may be a contracted version. Otherwise, the glossary entry must provide a complete definition.

## Task Description

### Prerequisites

1. **Familiarize with the glossary**: Review [tlad001.md](../tlad001.md) to understand existing terms
2. **Review project documentation**: Focus on recent additions or areas lacking glossary coverage  
3. **Identify last augmentation**: Check reviews directory for most recent glossary augmentation report (filename pattern `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-*-glossary-augmentation.md`)

### Step 1: Identify Candidate Terms

Scan documentation for technical terminology not in the glossary, prioritizing:

- Terms specific to the [SPaDE](../tlad001.md#spade) project
- Terms with special meanings in this project context
- Terms appearing frequently or in multiple contexts
- Terms that would benefit readers if defined

Exclude general terminology and common words.

### Step 2: Check for Existing Documentation

For each candidate term, search the project documentation for a suitable detailed explanation:

1. **Identify detailed accounts**: Look for sections that explain the term comprehensively
2. **Assess suitability**: Is the explanation stable, authoritative, and accessible?
3. **Note the location**: Record document path and section heading for linking

### Step 3: Draft Glossary Entries

For each selected term, draft an entry following the existing glossary format:

```markdown
### [Term Name](path/to/doc.md#section-anchor)

Brief definition, possibly contracted from the linked documentation.

Additional explanation if needed.

#### Related Terms
- **Variation 1**: Brief note
```

**If no suitable link exists**, provide a complete standalone definition:

```markdown
### Term Name

Complete definition of the term as used in SPaDE context.

Explanation of key characteristics, relationships to other concepts, etc.
```

**Content guidelines**:
- Be concise but complete
- Match the tone and style of existing entries
- Link to related glossary terms where applicable
- Focus on SPaDE-specific usage

### Step 4: Organize and Integrate

1. **Place entries alphabetically** within the appropriate letter section
2. **Add to index** if creating a new letter section
3. **Update cross-references** if related terms need links to the new entries
4. **Verify formatting** matches existing glossary style

## Deliverables

1. **Updated glossary file** (`docs/tlad001.md`) with new entries in a pull request
2. **Augmentation report** in reviews directory with filename `YYYYMMDD-HHMM-author-glossary-augmentation.md` containing:
   - Date of last glossary augmentation (for future reference)
   - Number of candidate terms considered
   - Terms added with brief rationale
   - Terms deferred with explanation
   - Links found to existing documentation

## Next Steps

After glossary augmentation is complete, run the incremental glossary linking task (amtd002.md) to add links from the documentation to the new glossary entries.
