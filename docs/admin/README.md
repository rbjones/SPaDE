# Administration and Collaboration Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the human/AI collaboration framework that is essential to the SPaDE project's success.

## Purpose

The SPaDE project aims to achieve goals that are not achievable without effective human/AI collaboration. This requires conscious development and clear documentation of:

- **Roles and responsibilities** between human and AI contributors
- **Methods and standards** for collaborative work
- **Workflows and processes** for effective collaboration
- **Quality assurance** and validation procedures

## Contents

### Collaboration Framework

- [**Roles and Responsibilities**](roles-responsibilities.md) - Definition of Bertie (philosopher/architect) and Alan (high-bandwidth contributor) roles
- [**Collaboration Methods**](collaboration-methods.md) - Standards and approaches for human/AI collaboration
- [**Workflows**](workflows.md) - Specific processes for different types of work
- [**Communication Protocols**](communication-protocols.md) - How we communicate and document our work

### Project Management

- [**Project Planning**](ACTION_PLAN.md) - Detailed implementation roadmap
- [**Issues Tracking**](ISSUES.md) - Comprehensive list of gaps and issues
- [**Project Structure**](../PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) - Proposed enhanced project organization

### Quality Assurance

- [**Review Standards**](review-standards.md) - How work is reviewed and validated
- [**Validation Procedures**](validation-procedures.md) - Ensuring correctness and alignment
- [**Feedback Loops**](feedback-loops.md) - Continuous improvement processes

## Principles

1. **Transparency**: All collaboration methods and decisions are documented
2. **Iterative Improvement**: The collaboration framework itself evolves
3. **Alignment**: AI contributions stay aligned with human vision
4. **Validation**: Human oversight ensures quality and direction
5. **Efficiency**: Leverage AI bandwidth while maintaining human depth

## Evolution

This framework will evolve as we learn what works best for our collaboration. All changes should be documented and justified based on our experience.
