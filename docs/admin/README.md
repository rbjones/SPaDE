# Administration and Collaboration Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the human/AI collaboration framework that is essential to the SPaDE project's success and all other matters of an administrative nature.

## Purpose

The SPaDE project aims to achieve goals that are not achievable without effective human/AI collaboration. This requires conscious development and clear documentation of:

- **Roles and responsibilities** between human and AI contributors
- **Methods and standards** for collaborative work
- **Workflows and processes** for effective collaboration
- **Quality assurance** and validation procedures

## Contents

### Project Management

A github project has been set up and github facilities will be used to manage tasks and issues.

### Quality Assurance

- [**Review Standards**](review-standards.md) - How work is reviewed and validated
- [**Validation Procedures**](validation-procedures.md) - Ensuring correctness and alignment
- [**Feedback Loops**](feedback-loops.md) - Continuous improvement processes

## Principles

1. **Transparency**: All collaboration methods and decisions are documented
2. **Iterative Improvement**: The collaboration framework itself evolves
3. **Alignment**: AI contributions stay aligned with human vision
4. **Validation**: Human oversight ensures quality and direction
5. **Efficiency**: Leverage AI bandwidth while maintaining human depth

## Evolution

This framework will evolve as we learn what works best for our collaboration.
