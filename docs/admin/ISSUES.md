# SPaDE Project Issues and Gaps

This document tracks issues that need to be addressed in the system description, organized by structural questions and gaps at different levels of detail.

This was drafted by agentic AI so it's way overweight and needs curtailing and massaging.
I have done some of that, but most I have left in place for further consideration.

## High-Level Conceptual Gaps

### Philosophical Foundation

- [ ] **Incomplete philosophical preliminaries**: `PhilosophicalPreliminaries.md` is only 11 lines
- [ ] **Missing definition of "declarative knowledge"**: Referenced but not defined

### Core Claims and Arguments

- [ ] **Incomplete universality argument**: `KRUniversality.md` is incomplete and has typos

### Paradigm Shift Description

- [ ] **Incomplete deductive paradigm description**: `DeductiveParadigm.md` barely progressed.
- [ ] **Missing transition strategy**: How do we get from current state to new paradigm?
- [ ] **Unclear benefits**: What specific advantages does this approach provide?

## Architectural Gaps

### Knowledge Repository Architecture

- [ ] **Missing distributed architecture specification**: How exactly does distribution work?

- [ ] **No consistency model**: How is logical consistency maintained across distributed repos?

### Deductive Kernel Design

- [ ] **Incomplete kernel specification**: `kernel.md` is informal and incomplete

- [ ] **Missing security considerations**: How is access control handled?

## Technical Implementation Gaps

### Formal Specifications

- [ ] **No formal syntax definitions**: What is the exact HOL variant being used?
- [ ] **Missing type system specification**: How are types handled?
- [ ] **No proof system specification**: What are the inference rules?
- [ ] **Missing metatheory formalization**: How is the system's own theory formalized?

### Implementation Strategy

- [ ] **No implementation language choice**: What language should be used?
- [ ] **Missing bootstrapping strategy**: How do we implement the system in itself?
- [ ] **No development roadmap**: What are the implementation phases?
- [ ] **Missing tooling requirements**: What development tools are needed?

### Integration and Interoperability

- [ ] **No migration strategy**: How do we transition from existing systems?
- [ ] **Missing compatibility specifications**: How does this work with existing HOL systems?
- [ ] **No import/export protocols**: How do we handle existing knowledge bases?
- [ ] **Missing tool integration**: How do existing tools integrate?

## AI Integration Gaps

### AI Capabilities Integration

- [ ] **Unclear AI role**: How exactly does AI fit into the architecture?
- [ ] **Missing AI-assisted proof generation**: How does AI help with proofs?
- [ ] **No AI training strategy**: How do we train AI on the system?
- [ ] **Missing human-AI collaboration model**: How do humans and AI work together?

### Verification and Trust

- [ ] **No verification strategy**: How do we verify AI-generated proofs?
- [ ] **Missing trust model**: How do we establish trust in the system?
- [ ] **No audit trail**: How do we track changes and decisions?
- [ ] **Missing quality assurance**: How do we ensure correctness?

## Practical Deployment Gaps

### Use Cases and Applications

- [ ] **No concrete use cases**: What are the first applications?
- [ ] **Missing domain-specific examples**: How does this apply to specific fields?
- [ ] **No performance benchmarks**: What are the expected performance characteristics?
- [ ] **Missing scalability analysis**: How does this scale to large problems?

### Community and Ecosystem

- [ ] **No community building strategy**: How do we build a user community?
- [ ] **Missing documentation standards**: What are the documentation requirements?
- [ ] **No contribution guidelines**: How do others contribute to the project?
- [ ] **Missing licensing strategy**: What are the licensing terms?

## Research and Development Gaps

### Research Questions

- [ ] **Unanswered theoretical questions**: What are the open research problems?
- [ ] **Missing experimental validation**: How do we validate the approach?
- [ ] **No comparison with alternatives**: How does this compare to other approaches?
- [ ] **Missing limitations discussion**: What are the known limitations?

### Development Priorities

- [ ] **No clear development priorities**: What should be implemented first?
- [ ] **Missing milestone definitions**: What are the key milestones?
- [ ] **No resource requirements**: What resources are needed?
- [ ] **Missing timeline**: What is the expected development timeline?

## Documentation and Communication Gaps

### Documentation Completeness

- [ ] **Incomplete technical paper**: `chdkrpaper.tex` has many incomplete sections
- [ ] **Missing glossary**: No definitions of key terms
- [ ] **No FAQ**: Common questions not addressed
- [ ] **Missing tutorials**: No getting started guides

### Communication Strategy

- [ ] **No clear messaging**: What is the elevator pitch?
- [ ] **Missing target audience definition**: Who is this for?
- [ ] **No value proposition**: What problem does this solve?
- [ ] **Missing differentiation**: How is this different from existing solutions?
