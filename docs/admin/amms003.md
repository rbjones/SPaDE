# Workflows

This section describes the workflows and processes that will be used to manage the project and ensure effective collaboration between human and AI contributors.

It's AI generated and therefore generic and will need to be adapted to the specific needs of this project.

## Collaboration Process

1. **Task Assignment**: Tasks will be assigned to either human or AI contributors based on expertise and availability.
2. **Progress Tracking**: All tasks will be tracked using GitHub Issues, with regular updates on progress.
3. **Communication**: Contributors are encouraged to use comments on GitHub Issues for discussions related to specific tasks.

## Review Process

1. **Pull Requests**: All code changes must be submitted via pull requests for review.
2. **Code Review**: Designated reviewers will assess pull requests for quality and adherence to project standards.
3. **Feedback**: Reviewers will provide feedback, and contributors must address all comments before merging.

## Integration Process

Since [SPaDE](../tlad001.md#spade) functionality will be delivered exclusively through MCP servers, testing will be undertaken by copilot acting as a client to the MCP server.

The process of building and deploying MCP servers will be automated using Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

The testing of the MCP server undertaken by copilot will be fully scripted (with the assistance of copilot) and will be automatically executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
