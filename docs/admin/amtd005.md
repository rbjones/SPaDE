# Task Description — Execute Glossary Augmentation Process

## Purpose

Run the glossary augmentation workflow exactly as described in [amms007.md](amms007.md), from Stage 1 candidate proposal through Stage 2 integration, so the procedure remains the single source of detailed steps.

## Required Outcomes

- Stage 1 artefacts prepared per `amms007.md`, including a draft PR that seeks Stage 1 review of the candidate YAML.
- The Stage 1 review may prune or extend the candidate list; Stage 2 begins only after those edits are incorporated.
- Stage 2 glossary edits, automated linking, and the final augmentation report (`reviews/YYYYMMDD-HHMM-copilot-glossary-augmentation.md`) delivered according to the procedure.
- Brief follow-up note capturing any deviations or follow-on actions before close-out.
