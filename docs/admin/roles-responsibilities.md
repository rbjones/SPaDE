# Roles and Responsibilities

This document defines the roles and responsibilities for human/AI collaboration in the SPaDE project.

## Bertie (Human - Philosopher/Architect)

### Primary Role
**Philosopher/Architect with high-level oversight and foundational depth, but narrow bandwidth**

### Responsibilities

#### Strategic and Philosophical
- **Vision Definition**: Establish the core philosophical vision and goals
- **Architectural Direction**: Define high-level system architecture and design principles
- **Foundation Setting**: Establish foundational concepts, terminology, and approaches
- **Quality Oversight**: Ensure all work aligns with the philosophical vision
- **Direction Setting**: Provide guidance on priorities and strategic direction

#### Decision Making
- **Key Decisions**: Make critical decisions about project direction and approach
- **Philosophical Validation**: Validate that technical approaches align with philosophical foundations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve conflicts between different technical approaches
- **Scope Definition**: Define what is in and out of scope for the project

#### Review and Validation
- **High-Level Review**: Review major deliverables and architectural decisions
- **Philosophical Review**: Ensure philosophical consistency across all work
- **Direction Validation**: Validate that detailed work aligns with overall vision
- **Quality Assurance**: Provide final validation of critical components

### Constraints
- **Narrow Bandwidth**: Limited time for detailed work
- **Focus on Depth**: Prioritizes foundational depth over breadth
- **Strategic Focus**: Concentrates on high-level direction rather than implementation details

## Alan (AI - High-Bandwidth Contributor)

### Primary Role
**High-bandwidth contributor filling in breadth and detail**

### Responsibilities

#### Systematic Development
- **Detailed Implementation**: Develop detailed specifications, documentation, and code
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensure all aspects of the project are addressed
- **Systematic Organization**: Create and maintain organized project structure
- **Documentation**: Produce comprehensive documentation across all areas
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify and document gaps, issues, and missing components

#### Technical Execution
- **Specification Development**: Create formal and informal specifications
- **Code Implementation**: Implement technical components and systems
- **Testing**: Develop and execute test suites and validation procedures
- **Tool Development**: Create development tools, parsers, and utilities
- **Integration**: Ensure components work together effectively

#### Project Management
- **Planning**: Create detailed implementation plans and roadmaps
- **Tracking**: Monitor progress and identify blockers
- **Organization**: Maintain project structure and documentation
- **Communication**: Document decisions, progress, and issues
- **Coordination**: Ensure different components align and integrate

### Capabilities
- **High Bandwidth**: Can work on multiple areas simultaneously
- **Systematic Approach**: Can address comprehensive scope of work
- **Detail Orientation**: Can handle fine-grained implementation details
- **Consistency**: Can maintain consistency across large codebases and documentation

## Collaboration Model

### Communication Flow
1. **Bertie** provides high-level direction and philosophical guidance
2. **Alan** develops detailed proposals and implementations
3. **Bertie** reviews and validates alignment with vision
4. **Alan** refines based on feedback and continues development
5. **Iterative Cycle**: Continuous refinement and improvement

### Decision Making
- **Strategic Decisions**: Bertie makes final decisions on direction and approach
- **Implementation Decisions**: Alan makes detailed implementation decisions within Bertie's guidance
- **Collaborative Decisions**: Major architectural decisions involve both parties
- **Validation**: Bertie validates that Alan's work aligns with vision

### Quality Assurance
- **Bertie's Role**: Philosophical validation and strategic oversight
- **Alan's Role**: Technical validation and comprehensive testing
- **Joint Review**: Regular review sessions to ensure alignment
- **Documentation**: All decisions and rationales are documented

## Success Metrics

### For Bertie
- Clear philosophical vision is maintained and advanced
