## D

### Declarative Knowledge

Knowledge captured in propositions expressed by sentences in a well defined declarative language.

### Declarative Language

Languages having sentences with *truth conditions*, the assertion of which affirms that those conditions hold.

### Deduction

The process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true.

### Deductive Engineering

An approach to engineering design and construction in which the formal modelling of requirements is progressed concurrently with automated deductively verified design and implementation.
Design methods are implemented as derived inference rules which prove compliance of designs with system specifications from premises about the characteristics of components and subsystems, thus progressively refining specifications into designs and implementations.

### Diasporic

Concerning the entire cosmic reach of the progeny of a single origin of intelligence, such as Planet Earth.

- **Diasporic Repository**: A distributed repository spanning the knowledge of an intelligent diaspora.
A maximal connected component of the pansophic repository.

## E

### Embedding

- The placement or incorporation of one thing within another.
- **Language Embedding**: A mapping of one language into another (possibly defined in a third language).
- **Semantic Embedding**: A language embedding that preserves meaning.
- **Shallow Embedding**: A semantic embedding which is not deep, and therefore does not require a target more expressive than the source language.
- **Deep Embedding**: A mapping (in a target- or meta-language) that represents the semantics of a source- or object-language, in a manner which supports metatheoretic reasoning about the language, typically as a function defined over the abstract syntax of that language.

### Epistemic

Concerning knowledge.

### Epistemology

The philosophical study of knowledge

### [Epistemological Stack](tlph003.md)

A conceptual framework for understanding how abstract deductive reasoning contributes to deduction in all domains of declarative knowledge.

### Evolution

## F

### Focal

Giving particular attention to parts of a whole.

- **Focal Intelligence or Focal AI**: AI systems specialising in narrow domains enemcumbered by the support of broader capabilities.
These will often be *perfect information spaces* in which competence can be achieved by exploration of the space without need of training data, as exemplified by Deepmind's AlphaZero.

- **[Focal Engineering](tlph004.md)**
The application of focal intelligence to engineering design problems (broadly construed).

- **[Focal Tower](tlph004.md/#a-focal-tower)**
A conceptual framework for understanding how focal engineering (including singular foci) can be applied to problems in various domains, by identifying the perfect information spaces within those domains and applying appropriate focal AI techniques to solve problems within those spaces.

## I

### Institution

1. An organised society or establishment founded for a specific purpose.

2. A category of related logical systems sharing common syntax and semantics, such as first order logic or higher order logic.

### Foundational Institution

An ordinally indexed family of logical systems sharing common syntax but with semantics defined by increasingly strong notions of model, such that for any member of the family there exists a subsequent member in which the semantics of the former can be rendered as a deep embedding.

### Universal Foundational Institution

A maximally expressive foundational institution.

## M

### Metaphysics

The philosophical (as opposed to scientific, and hence *a priori*) study of the nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, substance and attribute, and potentiality and actuality.
In [Synthetic Philosophy](tlph002.md), which follows logical positivism in rejecting the synthetic *a priori*, the residual metaphysics is ontological and conventional.

## P

### Pansophic

Concerning all knowledge in the cosmos.

## S

### Semantics

- The study of meaning in language, including the relationship between signifiers and what they signify.
- A systematic assignment of meanings to the symbols and expressions of a formal language.

### Semantic Embedding

- A mapping of one formal language into another that preserves meaning, allowing expressions from the source language to be represented in the target language without loss of semantic content.

### Semantic Expressiveness

- The ability of a formal language to represent a wide range of meanings, concepts and propositions.
- A measure of the richness of the semantics of a logical system, often related to the variety and complexity of models that can be represented within that system.
- The pre-ordering of logical systems induced by the existence of semantic embeddings between them.
- The pre-ordering of foundational institutions induced by the existence of semantic embeddings between their members.

### The Singularity

A hypothesised future point at which technological progress, particularly in AI, becomes so rapid and profound that it defies human understanding and control.
Often associated with the acceleration of AI development expected when AI is able to improve its own capabilities or design its succesors autonomously.

### Singular Focus

The use of focal intelligence to accelerate progress, by giving priority to the capabilities which enable AI to improve its own design and implementation.
There are multiple levels at which focus on reflexive capabilities can be beneficial, and this is a special kind of *focal engineering* incorporated into the development strategy for SPaDE.

### SPaDE

An acronym for *Synthetic Philosophy and Deductive Engineering*.
The name of an open source knowledge engineering project with a repository at [github.com/rbjones/SPaDE](https://github.com/rbjones/SPaDE).

### Synthetic

Constructed rather than discovered.

- **[Synthetic Epistemology](tlph002.md#epistemology)(SPaDE)**
Those part of *synthetic philosophy* (SPaDE) seeking to understand knowledge by designing the epistemic engines of the future.
- **Synthetic Philosophy(1)**: A philosophical approach that seeks to integrate and unify knowledge from diverse fields and disciplines into a coherent, comprehensive worldview or system of understanding.
- **[Synthetic Philosophy](tlph002.md)(SPaDE)**
A constructive philosophy seeking to understand the future by shaping it, primarily through deductive engineering including *synthetic epistemology*.

## T

### Terran

Concerning Planet Earth.

- **Terran Diaspora**: The intelligent progeny of *homo sapiens*.

- **Terran Diasporic Repository**: The distributed repository encompassing the declarative knowledge of the terran diaspora.
