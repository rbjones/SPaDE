## A

### Analytic

See also: *[synthetic](#synthetic)*.

Obtained by breaking something complex down into its constituent parts or elements.

#### Analytic (Kant)

A judgement or proposition where the predicate is contained in the concept of the subject.
A proposition which is derivable from the principle of non-contradiction alone.

#### Analytic Proof (ancient Greece)

A proof which proceeds by analysis from the conclusion to be proved back to axioms and premises.

#### Analytic Philosophy

A philosophical tradition that emphasizes clarity and logical rigor, often through the analysis of language and concepts.

#### Analytic Sentence

A sentence that is true in virtue of its meaning alone, independent of empirical verification (though not independent of the logic required to establish that meaning?).
A tautology. A sentence of which the truth conditions are satisfied in all possible circumstances.

[The truth of the sentence in fact depends only on that part of the meaning which consists in its truth conditions, and to say that it depends only on those conditions is to say that the truth conditions are the constant function yielding true (and it is therefore what we call a logically necessary proposition).  Hence once its meaning is established (in this formal sense) not even logic is required to establish its truth.
Of course this formal stance may not be convincing when considering natural languages, but the difficulty is primarily in establishing the meaning, or even deciding what meaning is.]

## D

### Declarative Knowledge

Knowledge captured in propositions expressed by sentences in a well defined declarative language.

### Declarative Language

Languages having sentences with *truth conditions*, the assertion of which affirms that those conditions hold.

### Deduction

The process of deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true.

### [Deductive Engineering](tlad007.md)

An approach to engineering design and construction in which the formal modelling of requirements is progressed concurrently with automated deductively verified design and implementation.
Design methods are implemented as derived inference rules which prove compliance of designs with system specifications from premises about the characteristics of components and subsystems, thus progressively refining specifications into designs and implementations.

### Diasporic

Concerning the entire cosmic reach of the progeny of a single origin of intelligence, such as Planet Earth.

#### Diasporic Repository

A distributed repository spanning the knowledge of an intelligent diaspora.
A maximal connected component of the pansophic repository.

## E

### Embedding

The placement or incorporation of one thing within another.

#### Language Embedding

A mapping of one language into another (possibly defined in a third language).

#### Embedding (Semantic)

A language embedding that preserves meaning, see: [Semantic Embedding](tlad001.md#semantic-embedding).

#### Shallow Embedding

A semantic embedding which is not deep, and therefore does not require a target more expressive than the source language.

#### Deep Embedding

A mapping (in a target- or meta-language) that represents the semantics of a source- or object-language, in a manner which supports metatheoretic reasoning about the language, typically as a function defined over the abstract syntax of that language.

### Epistemic

Concerning knowledge.

### Epistemology

The philosophical study of knowledge or philosophical theories about knowledge.

### [Epistemological Stack](tlph003.md)

A conceptual framework for understanding how abstract deductive reasoning contributes to deduction in all domains of declarative knowledge. Also contributing to the understanding of the *[focal tower](#focal-tower)*.

### Evolution

## F

### Focal

Giving particular attention to parts of a whole.

#### Focal Intelligence or Focal AI

AI systems specialising in narrow domains unencumbered by the support of broader capabilities.
These will often be *perfect information spaces* in which competence can be achieved by exploration of the space without need of training data, as exemplified by DeepMind's AlphaZero.

#### [Focal Tower](tlad008.md)

A conceptual framework for understanding how focal engineering (including singular foci) can be applied to problems in various domains, by identifying the perfect information spaces within those domains and applying appropriate focal AI techniques to solve problems within those spaces.

## I

### Institution

1. An organised society or establishment founded for a specific purpose.

2. A category of related logical systems sharing common syntax and semantics, such as first order logic or higher order logic.

### Foundational Institution

An ordinally indexed family of logical systems, sharing common syntax but with semantics defined by increasingly strong notions of model, such that for any member of the family there exists a subsequent member in which the semantics of the former can be rendered as a *[deep embedding](tlad001.md#deep-embedding)* (and is therefore strictly more expressive).

### Universal Foundational Institution

A maximally expressive foundational institution.

## M

### Metaphysics

The philosophical (as opposed to scientific, and hence *a priori*) study of the nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, substance and attribute, and potentiality and actuality.
In [Synthetic Philosophy](tlph002.md), which follows logical positivism in rejecting the synthetic *a priori*, the residual metaphysics is ontological and conventional.

## P

### Pansophic

Concerning all knowledge in the cosmos.

### [Perfect Information Space](./tlad005.md#perfect-information-spaces)

A domain characterized by complete observability, well-defined rules, deterministic behavior, finite and discrete state/action spaces, objective evaluation criteria, and self-contained specification.
Examples include chess, Go, and formal proof systems.
Perfect information spaces are precisely coextensive with formal deductive theories and define the scope of focal methods.
See [Perfect Information Spaces and Focal Methods](tlad005.md) for detailed treatment.

## S

### Semantics

- The study of meaning in language, including the relationship between signifiers and what they signify.
- A systematic assignment of meanings to the symbols and expressions of a formal language.

### Semantic Embedding

- A mapping of one formal language into another that preserves meaning, allowing expressions from the source language to be represented in the target language without loss of semantic content.

### Semantic Expressiveness

- The ability of a formal language to represent a wide range of meanings, concepts and propositions.
- A measure of the richness of the semantics of a logical system, often related to the variety and complexity of models that can be represented within that system.
- The pre-ordering of logical systems induced by the existence of semantic embeddings between them.
- The pre-ordering of *foundational institutions* induced by the existence of semantic embeddings between their members.

### The Singularity

A hypothesised future point at which technological progress, particularly in AI, becomes so rapid and profound that it defies human understanding and control.
Often associated with the acceleration of AI development expected when AI is able to improve its own capabilities or design its succesors autonomously.

### Singular Focus

The use of focal intelligence to accelerate progress, by giving priority to the capabilities which enable AI to improve its own design and implementation.
There are multiple levels at which focus on reflexive capabilities can be beneficial, and this is a special kind of *focal engineering* incorporated into the development strategy for SPaDE.

### SPaDE

An acronym for *Synthetic Philosophy and Deductive Engineering*.
The name of an open source knowledge engineering project with a repository at [github.com/rbjones/SPaDE](https://github.com/rbjones/SPaDE).

### Synthetic

See also: [analytic](#analytic).

Constructed rather than discovered.

#### Synthetic (Kant)

A judgement or proposition where the predicate adds new information not already contained in the concept of the subject.

#### Synthetic Proof (ancient Greece)

A proof which proceeds from axioms and premises to a conclusion by direct logical inference.

#### [Synthetic Epistemology](tlph002.md#epistemology) (SPaDE)

Those parts of *synthetic philosophy* (SPaDE) seeking to understand knowledge by designing the epistemic engines of the future.

#### [Synthetic Philosophy](tlph002.md)

An approach to philosophy which seeks to integrate and unify knowledge from diverse fields and disciplines into a coherent, comprehensive worldview or system of understanding.

#### [Synthetic Philosophy](tlph002.md) (SPaDE)

A constructive philosophy seeking to understand the future by shaping it, primarily through deductive engineering including *synthetic epistemology*.

#### Synthetic Sentence

A sentence that is not analytically true; its truth conditions are non-trivial.  A sentence expressing a contingent proposition.

## T

### Terran

Concerning Planet Earth.

#### Terran Diaspora

The intelligent progeny of *homo sapiens*.

#### Terran Diasporic Repository

The distributed repository encompassing the declarative knowledge of the terran diaspora.
