# Synthetic Philosophy

In the SPaDE project, philosophy and engineering are cheek by jowl, and the distinction between them is not clearly made.
A central point of engagement is throught the emphasis in deductive engineering on the exploitation of knowledge in the solution of real world problems, and the importance of epistemology as a fundamental approach to knowledge and the design of infrastructure for the management and exploitation of knowledge.
Once philosophy is thought of as synthesis rather than an observation, it becomes a necessary prelude to the architecture of knowledge repositories and application of deductive methods to engineering problems.

Logical Positivism was that manifestation of positivism created in the wake of the great advances in the logical foundations of mathematics which took place around the turn of the 20th century.
In the philosophy of Rudolf Carnap, inspired by the work of Bertrand Russell on the formalisation of mathematics and his ideas for "scientific philosophy", it promoted and facilitated the application of formal deductive systems to the advancement of logical rigour in philosophy and science.
[Synthetic Philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy) is intended as a successor to Logical Positivism, oriented more broadly to Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and to all applications in which deduction may play a role.

The structure of this exposition is a bit like a roller coaster.
In various ways I think of SPaDE and its philosophy as a stack with certain things at the top and others below.
There are multiple presentations having that kind of structure, some more philosophically oriented, in particular the [epistemological stack](tlph003.md), and some more engineering oriented, notably the [focal tower](tlph004.md).
From the philosophical perspective, at the bottom are the foundations: metaphysics, philosophy of language, epistemology, logic and *a priori* or analytic truth, in the middle empirical knowledge the STE of STEM, and at the top the third of the Humean trichotomy values, ethics and *purpose*.

We begin at the top, so that the whole may be considered in the light of the supervening purpose which it is intended to serve, and then look down to the foundations which underpin it, concluding rather more briefly in the middle ground, which for present purposes I characterise as *concrete philosophy*.

## Superstructure

Probably the parts of this *philosophy* which are closest to academic analytic philosophy are those closest to the philosophical and logical foundations.
But these ideas are unlikely to be well understood in isolation from the broader context of the *engineering* and *ethical* purpose which motivates them, and determines the synthetic character of the philosophy.

In this document I shall try to address the foundational elements of synthetic philosophy, but feel the need to place those ideas in the context they serve by saying a litle about the superstructure which they are intended to support.

### Purpose

Synthetic Philosophy has purpose, and is engineered to advance that purpose.

[Synthetic Philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy) is the name I have adopted for a successor to logical positivism oriented more broadly to Science, Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).

That orientation is instrumental.
Synthetic philosophy is itself engineered to advance an ethical agenda derived from a rational speculation about the very long term future of intelligence in the cosmos.
A sketch of the thinking which has lead to Synthetic Philosophy may be found as a [A STEM Fantasy and Ethical Consequence](tlph001.md).

It is therefore a purposeful philosophy, anticipating key elements of the longer term proliferation of intelligence with the intent of influencing the moral character of that proliferation.
At this point, I have little more to say about that purpose than that the proliferation should be benign, which I associate a preference for cooperation over conflict.
Hopefully some elaboration and refinement will emerge as the project progresses, but the project will be mainly focussed on the manner in which its proliferation is engineered.


Synthetic Philosophy has a layered structure which corresponds both to an [epistemological stack](tlph003.md) and a [focal tower](tlph004.md).

The epistemological stack reflects the tripartite division in declarative knowledge, found in the philosophy of David Hume and also in Logical Positivism, into analytic, synthetic and normative knowledge.
This is considered a stack since each layer builds on and makes use of the previous layers.
In this, it is similar to a software stack.
It is also a foundational structure (of more than three layers) most conspicuous in the lower levels where we find philosophy and logic providing formal foundations for mathematics and all analytic knowledge, which in turn provide a basis for science and engineering.
The normative layer at the top of the stack is concerned with values and ethics, and provides the motivation for the whole enterprise of knowledge acquisition and application.

The focal tower reflects the importance of specialisations to the effectiveness of constructive endeavours, and the focus required to address difficult problems in each domain.
It recognises a variety of ways in which focus is enabled and exploited, the most basic of which corresponds to the layers of the epistemological stack,

 in which abstract deductive reasoning underpins concrete knowledge of the world, which in turn underpins normative knowledge of values and ethics.
in which abstract deductive reasoning underpins concrete knowledge of the world, which in turn underpins normative knowledge of values and ethics.

A feature of the [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) project is its emphasis on *[focal](tlad001.md#focal) methods*, which involves the clarification of purpose and the concentration of effort on those aspects of knowledge engineering which are most relevant to the achievement of that purpose.

The [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) project is an engineering manifestation of that philosophy, and this presentation of [synthetic philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy) is intended to show the main features of the philosophical system in alignment with the goals and structure of the project.

[Synthetic Philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy) is primarily *epistemological*, which is to say that it is intended to underpin the acquisition and application of knowledge.
It is presented here as falling into three parts, distinguished by the epistemological status of the propositions which concern them, and the domains of knowledge to which they relate.

1. [*Abstract Philosophy*](#abstract-philosophy) underpins the whole enterprise, and does so by addressing *a priori* knowledge in abstract domainsand its relation to [declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge) generally.
2. [*Concrete Philosophy*](#concrete-philosophy) is concerned with knowledge of the "real world", mediated by abstract mmodels.
3. [*Normative Philosophy*](#normative-philosophy) is concerned with purpose, values and ethics.

These three parts of [synthetic philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy) are interrelated.
Each is prerequisite to its successors, and a motivator for its predecessors.
This relationship is discussed in greater detail as constituting an [Epistemological Stack](tlph003.md) which influences the architecture of the [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) project.
This epistemological stack of synthetic philosophyis complemented by a parallel structure in the [Focal Tower](tlph004.md) of stages in *deductive engineering* supporting evolution of information processing to a deductive paradigm.

## Foundations

Though practically, and ethically oriented, [synthetic philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy) includes and is constructed upon foundations belonging to what is here labelled *abstract philosophy* by which I mean:
- [epistemology](#epistemology) - on [declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge) and its applications
- [metaphysics](#metaphysics) - on what there is
- [logic](#logic) - on deductive reasoning and the nature of logical truth
- [philosophy of language](#philosophy-of-language) - primarily concerning declarative language

 All these areas are generally construed more broadly than their foundational role in this notion of abstract philosophy requires.
 It is characteristic of the approach to these matters in [synthetic philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy) that they are treated constructively, not primarily as matters to be discovered so much as domains to be synthesised, though a part of the enterprise does involve discovering the consequences of those constructions.

Abstract philosophy is *foundational* for [synthetic philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy).
The great edifice of human knowledge is best thought of as constructed on philosophical foundations, consideration of which has an important role to play in its future advancement as intelligence proliferates beyond its earthly confines.

These deepest philosophical foundations are those parts of knowledge which are least influenced by the particulars of human origins and culture, and among the features of our distant future which we can most reliably extrapolate from contemporary knowledge.
The natural numbers, to chose a simple example, are likely to be a part of the knowledge of any intelligent beings, human or artificial, wherever they may be found in the cosmos

In describing these philosophical foundations *ab initio*, no one of the four disciplines can be independently accounted for, they are intertwined and interdependent, though the emphasis of the [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) project on the representation, manipulation and application of [declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge) places [epistemology](tlad001.md#epistemology) as primary among them.

I shall give here the briefest possible sketch of the main features of the four components of theoretical philosophy as they relate to the [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) project.

### Epistemology

Though there are many kinds of knowledge, the [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) project is concerned primarily with *[declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge)*, i.e. knowledge which may be expressed in declarative language, considering this as its most advanced form, to which other forms of knowledge may be reduced.

[SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) accepts the tripartite division of knowledge into *relations of ideas*, *matters of fact*, and *value judgements* emphasised by David Hume, regarding these as layers in an [epistemological stack](tlad001.md#epistemological-stack), which influences the [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) strategy for the representation and application of [declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge).
Alongside this epistemological stack we describe a more finely grained *[focal tower](tlad001.md#focal-tower)* which influences the architecture of [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) and facilitates the advancement of knowledge through [focal engineering](tlad001.md#focal-engineering) methods which focus on the most relevant aspects of knowledge for a given task.

### Metaphysics

[Synthetic philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy) is metaphysically conventionalist.
The world is as it is, but in order to speak of we must divide it into parts, and that division is a matter of convention, influenced by our purposes in speaking of it.
It is convenient in the establishment of declarative language to think of language in the first instance as consisting of abstract entities conveying knowledge about abstract entities, which may then be applied through the articulation of correspondences between abstract and concrete entities, thereby effecting models which approximate the structure of reality in practically useful ways.

Working in the first instance with such abstract declarative language provides the methods and tools for the construction of models of both physical and ethical systems, and enables reliable deductive methods to be applied in all domains of [declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge).

In order to effect this abstract foundation, it is necessary to chose appropriate abstract domains, and we will find when we come to discuss the expressiveness of declarative languages and the possibility of universal declarative languages, that the key choice to be made in relation to those abstract domains is cardinality.
It does not matter *what* these abstract entities are, only *how many* there are.

The conventionalist metaphysics of [synthetic philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy) may this be reduced to the thesis that we may chose whatever abstract ontology we please, but at bottom the choice is just one of cardinality and the difficult problems in this domain concern how to express the choice of cardinality in declarative language, how to devise propositions which are logically consistent but are only satisfiable in models of sufficient size (in set theory, these are the large cardinal axioms).

These are however, from the perspective of synthetic philosophy, analogous to debating how many angels may dance on the head of a pin, since the practical application of [declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge) does not depend on very large cardinals.
It is doubtful whether any practical application of [declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge) will be expedited by the assumption of more than an unbounded set of inaccessibles.
(I will not go into how few might suffice, since practical advantages of ontological parsimony are moot, notwithstanding Occam.)

### Philosophy of Language

It is tempting to say that the whole point of [declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge) is to enable us to shape our world through the construction of models which enable is to use [deduction](tlad001.md#deduction) to predict and control phenomena in the world.
But [deduction](tlad001.md#deduction) is a feature of declarative language, and we cannot give an account of if without first addressing the nature of declarative language.

### Logic

The propositions of declarative language express through their truth conditions constraints on how their subject matter may be, which is to say what things the various names in the language may denote.
These constraints give rise to a relationship of entailment, which obtains when the constraints imposed by some set of declarative sentences encompass those imposed by another sentence.
In such cases we may infer the latter sentence from the former set.
This is the essence of deductive reasoning, which is the method by which scientific theories can be applied to predict and control phenomena in the world.

In order to determine when such entailments obtain, we seek an effective method for establishing entailments.
For languages of sufficient expressiveness for many practical applications, it is known that no such effective method exists, but practically useful semi-decision procedures are available which suffice for practical applications.

These semi-decision procedures are the subject matter of [logic](tlad001.md#logic) as it relates to [declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge), and the design of such procedures is a key part of the [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) project, in which some innovation is anticipated.
The procedures are normally defined as the closure of a set of axioms under a set of 'primitive' inference rules, and the most rigorous automated support for formal reasoning found in interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are often implemented in accordance with the 'LCF paradigm', in which all theorems must be proven by reduction to the primitive inference rules.
Increasingly however, ITPs support some kind of 'reflexive' metatheoretic extension to the primitive rules in which more efficient forms of reasoning may be shown to be consistent with the primitive rules and may then be applied directly without reduction to the primitive rules.

Such metatheoretic extension is part of a broader application of reflexion forming a key part of the focal engineering methods pervasive in the [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) project.
A significant instance of this comes in the idea of *singular focus*, where reflexive methods incorporated into the realisation of some capability enable that capability to improve its own design and implementation.

## Concrete Philosophy

Concrete philosophy is the domain of empirical truth and physical engineering.
In the SPaDE project, concrete philosophy is addressed through the construction and application of abstract models of physical systems, expressed in declarative language and subject to deductive reasoning.
We may think of these models as isomorphic to aspects of the material world and given semantically by a bijection between the abstract entities of the model and the concrete entities of the physical system being modelled.


## Normative Philosophy

The normative part of [synthetic philosophy](tlad001.md#synthetic-philosophy) is concerned with purpose, values and ethics.
