# SPaDE Project Philosophy, Architecture, and Administration

This directory covers those aspects of the SPaDE project which are not specific to any one component, primarily concerning philosophical background, architecture, and administrative matters.

Philosophy and architecure are intertwined and therefore begin toether with:

[**Philosophy and Architecture (tlph006.md)**](./tlph006.md)

Adminstrative matters are covered in the:

[**Admin Directory**](admin/README.md)

We also have:

 [**The SPaDE glossary (tlad001.md)**](tlad001.md)

 covering special terminology and abuse of language.
 Linked to relevant parts of the project documentation make this an alternate way of exploring the project.
