# CHDKR Project Documentation

The chdkr project has the following main objectives:

* To argue that the abstract representation of the logic known
as _Cambridge HOL_ is suitable as a general representation form for
declarative knowledge irrespective of what language or coding it may have been presented or stored in.

* To articulate a conception of a deductive paradigm shift which,
with the benefit of effective automation only possible through AI
will transform the exploitation of declarative knowledge
from computation processes of uncertain effect to
deductively sound inference yielding unambiguous and reliable truths.

* To build an abstract inference engine supporting those processes
in a manner independent of the concrete syntax or stored form
of the knowledge establishing the context for the inference.
