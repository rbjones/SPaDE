 Philosophy and Architecture

In the following sketch philosophy and engineering are intertwined to yield a philosophically rooted architecture for purposeful knowledge engineering.

The story is presented in the following stages:

* Philosophical Foundations

Here we consider the nature of declarative knowledge, its layered tripartite division (an epistemological stack) following Hume, the existence of universal abstract foundational representations, and the representation around which the proposed architecture is based.
Beyond the language we are concerned with the nature of deduction and its relation with computation, adopting a novel conception of formal proof.

* The Focal Tower and Heirarchy

The architecture is substantially influenced by the advantages to the realisation of engineering intelligence of focal techniques, singular focus, the focal tower and focal heirarchies.
The focal tower and heirarchy are related to but more intricate than the epistemological stack.

* Evolutionary Imperatives

The top of both an epistemological stack and the focal tower provide purpose ethic for this work, motivating an emphasis on collaboration in all aspects of the project.
