# Synthetic Philosophy

Logical Positivism was that manifestation of positivism created in the wake of the great advances in the logical foundations of mathematics which too place around the end of the 19th century.
In the philosophy of Rudolf Carnap it promoted and facilitated the application of formal deductive systems to the advancement of logical rigour in science.

Synthetic Philosophy is the name I have adopted for a successor to logical positivism oriented more broadly to Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).

The SPaDE project is an engineering manifestation of that philosophy, and this presentation of synthetic philosophy is intended to show the main features of the philosophical system in alignment with the goals and structure of the project.

The project anticipates a long term proliferation of intelligence across the cosmos, and seeks to support that process on a logical, practical and ethical basis.
