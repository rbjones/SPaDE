# Focal Engineering

It is surely a commonplace that the solution of difficult intellectual problems requires focus.
This is of course, just the opposite of what we see in LLMs, which are trained on massive datasets and are not only costly to train, but also not cheap to apply to simple problems.
Problems which require deep thinking are explicitly provided for in many models by getting the LLM to think twice (or more) and reflect upon its results.
Away from the generality of LLMs, AI has lately had success in narrower domains by using more focussed methods, notably the deepmind alpha-zero has shown the benefits of focus upon the problem domain at hand.

Alongside the effectiveness of focus in some narrow domains, it sometimes happens that the solution of a relatively broad problem set may be facilitated by focus on certain key subproblems.
A special case of this comes with the idea of "[the singularity](tlad001.md#the-singularity)", the point at which AI becomes capable of redesigning itself leading to progressive acceleration of the AI design cycle and hyperexponential grown in the capabilities of artificial superintelligence.
Here we see that focus on the problem of AI design may be expected to advance capability in design across the board, and the potential suggests talking of this as a benefit of _[singular focus](tlad001.md#singular-focus)_.

It may be that the benefits of focus, and the possibility of [singular focus](tlad001.md#singular-focus), can be turned into architectural models and strategic plans, and that is the purpose of this note.

There are two kinds of focal thinking which contribute to the proposed architecture.
These come as a _[focal tower](tlad001.md#focal-tower)_ and a _[focal](tlad001.md#focal) hierarchy_ which are discussed in turn.

## A Focal Tower

To that end, I identify an ultimate purpose, and a fundamental technology, and show how [focal](tlad001.md#focal) methods can be used to construct a tower which leads us as efficiently as possible from the fundamentals to the ends.

The tower consists of a number of "[focal](tlad001.md#focal) layers".
Each later has some notion of competence in addressing a range of problems in a particular context, and a special subdomain competence in which facilitates the delivery of competence in the broader domain.
As we advance up the stack, the level and breadth of the relevant capabilities advances, and the context in which those competences are delivered becomes less supportive.

The stack can have any number of layers, so a sketch with a small number is the best place to start.
From the bottom up:

1. *Logic and Software Engineering*
  In this the broad capability is in logical reasoning in a logical system suitable for all deductive reasoning about [declarative knowledge](tlad001.md#declarative-knowledge).
  The context in which that capability is exercised is contemporary accelerated computing.
  The focus, which is a [singular focus](tlad001.md#singular-focus), is on reasoning about programs, since the embraces the capability to completely re-engineer this kind of reasoning capability.

2. *Engineering Design*
  The next layer takes us out of the purely logical into the physical work, from engineering software to engineering physical artefacts.
  The context for such engineering is the world as we find it, with existing physical system to support design and manufacturing, and the focus is on the advancement of the physical infrastructure supporting design and manufacture.

3. *Ecosystem Engineering*
  The previous layer a capability in the context of what we now have on planet Earth.
  What happens as we try to establish such a capability on some other planet?
  Then we have to move to the design of a completely new system which will function in a context which is devoid of most everything we have here on planet earth.
4. *Interstellar Proliferation*

### The Epistemological Connection

The [focal tower](tlad001.md#focal-tower) as described above correlates with the [epistemological stack](tlph003.md) in the following way.

TODO explain the correlation.

## The Focal Hierarchy

In a [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) repository (and in any ITP like reasoning system) there is a natural hierarchy of theories, each theory building on its parents.
Each theory is a perfect information space, since all answers all the information which can be used in determining theoremhood is available in the theory or its parents.
The cumulative aggregate of the extensions in a theory and its ancestors is called in [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade) a _context_, and each context is a perfect information space, suitable for [focal](tlad001.md#focal) reasoning by a specialist in that context.
Since the theories are arranged in a hierarchy, the contexts are also arranged in a hierarchy.
In [SPaDE](tlad001.md#spade), the hierarchy is mirrored by a hierarchy of reasoning specialists which continuously learn both by undertaking reasoning tasks subcontracted to them, and by independent exploration of their context.
