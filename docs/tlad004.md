# Perspectives on SPaDE

There are many quasi-geometric structures which illuminate different aspects of the SPaDE project.
I thought it might be instructive to gather them together, and this document is my attempt to do so.
I'll gather them into related groups.

By quasi-geometric I mean perspectives which we give labels such as "stack", "tower", "hierarchy", "network", "lattice", "graph", "tree", and so on.

But pro-tem, to help me do that I'll just list them here,

- **Linear Structures**
  - The *Epistemological Stack*, which organises kinds of declarative knowledge according to their epistemological status.
  - The *Focal Tower*, which elaborates on the epistemological stack in presenting singular foci.
- **Hierarchical Structures**
  - The *name space hierarchy*: this is a downward progressing tree through folders terminating in the signatures associated with extensions in theories.
  - The *logical context hierarchy* and *focal hierarchy*: this is a tree of ambivalent sense.  One may think of these contexts as reaching upward by progressive extensions to the primitive context provided by the foundation system, or we may think of it genealogically as progressing downward through the relationship between theories and their parents (which they extend) and their children (which extend them).
  It is also a focal hierarchy since each context is a perfect information space which may be the subject of focal intelligence.
  The structure of this hierarchy also determines the layered structure of focal intelligence in which the specialist for a context will subcontract to specialists for its subcontexts for subproblems which are confined to those subcontexts.
- **Planar Structures**
  - The *subsystem plane*: The three subsystems of SPaDE: knowledge representation, deductive kernel, deductive intelligence.
- **Network Structures**
  - The specialists of *deductive intelligence*: The network of specialist intelligent agents cooperating to solve problems which span multiple contexts.
