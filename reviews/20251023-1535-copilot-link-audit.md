# Link Integrity Audit Report

**Date**: 23 October 2025 15:35
**Contributor**: copilot
**Scope**: Entire repository excluding historical material under `reviews/`

## Summary

- Confirmed all markdown files in scope are referenced from their parent directory `README.md` files (no missing entries detected).
- Repaired internal documentation links reported by the scan, notably in `mcp/spade-mcp/README.md`, `dk/README.md`, and `docs/admin/README.md`.
- Updated `docs/admin/amtd001.md` to clarify that legacy content in `reviews/` is outside the task scope.

## Internal Link Validation

- Tooling: Python regex walker (see session command history) skipping `.git`, `.venv`, `node_modules`, `inspector`, and `reviews`.
- Result: `TOTAL 0` missing internal targets after corrections.
- Key fixes:
  - Removed references to absent `.vscode` and `.aitk` assets in `mcp/spade-mcp/README.md` and revised guidance.
  - Percent-encoded Wikipedia URLs with embedded parentheses in `dk/README.md`.
  - Replaced the broken GitHub Projects hyperlink in `docs/admin/README.md` with descriptive text.

## External Link Validation

- Method: Python `urllib` GET requests with `User-Agent` header across scope (13 URLs checked).
- Outcome: `FAILURES 0` after repairs; previous failures resolved by percent-encoding URLs and removing the invalid GitHub Projects link.

## Outstanding Issues

- None identified within the audited scope.

## Recommendations

- Provide `.vscode/` launch/task templates if future MCP documentation continues to reference them, or keep guidance text explicit that users must supply their own configuration.

## Suggestions on Contributor Instructions

- No additional changes required beyond the scope clarification already applied to `docs/admin/amtd001.md`.
